# MaxMSP Brass Interface
A visual interface for creating NESS Brass score files and instruments. 

Requires the [NESS binary](http://www.ness.music.ed.ac.uk/music-and-tools/releases):
- Download and unzip
- place the "ness-brass" binary inside the Ness-Brass-Interface folder

Currently OS X only (probably) as it relies on the [shell.mxo object](https://github.com/jeremybernstein/shell/releases/tag/1.0b2)
