# MaxMSP Brass Interface

A visual interface for creating NESS Brass score files and instruments. Add the [NESS binary](http://www.ness.music.ed.ac.uk/music-and-tools/releases) inside this folder to process the score and instrument files directly from the patch.

Currently OS X only (probably) as it relies on the [shell.mxo object](https://github.com/jeremybernstein/shell/releases/tag/1.0b2)
